# Eye-Blink-and-Facial-Detection-
Individuals affected by paralysis particularly those with limited movement or speech often struggle to interact and communicate effectively with their surroundings. This project introduces a cost-effective, AI-assisted solution that employs an eye blink detection sensor in combination with the ESP32 microcontroller to enable communication through basic eye
gestures.
The system utilizes a non-invasive infrared sensor to monitor intentional blinks, which are
interpreted as input signals. These signals are then processed by the ESP32, a compact and
energy-efficient microcontroller equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. By
programming the device to identify specific blink patterns such as single, double, or prolonged
blinks users can trigger predefined actions like affirming responses, sending emergency
signals, or controlling household appliances.
To enhance user safety and prevent unauthorized access, facial recognition is integrated into
the system using AI technologies. This feature can be implemented externally through
platforms like TensorFlow Lite or via an onboard ESP32-compatible camera module such as
the ESP32-CAM. It ensures that the device responds only to the registered user, thereby improving System reliability
